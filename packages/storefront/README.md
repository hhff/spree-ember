The Spree Ember Storefront is a collection of routes, templates and components
that work out of the box with the [Spree](http://github.com/spree/spree) rails 
engine via [Spree AMS](http://github.com/hhff/spree_ams).

It uses:
* [Spree Ember Core](http://www.spree-ember.com/core/index.html)
* [Spree Ember Checkouts](http://www.spree-ember/checkouts/index.html)

## Installation

```bash
ember install spree-ember-storefront
```

This will install all of the Storefront templates into your host application.

Now, you'll need to tell Ember's router where to put the standard Spree routes.

In `router.js`:

```javascript
import Ember from 'ember';
import config from './config/environment';

// This line imports the Spree Router.
import spreeRouter from 'spree-ember-storefront/router';

var Router = Ember.Router.extend({
  location: config.locationType
});

Router.map(function() {
  spreeRouter(this, config);
});

export default Router;
```

## Disable Normalize.css & Zurb Foundation

Spree Ember Storefront includes Normalize & Zurb Foundation into your CSS tree.
If you'd like to disable them, you can optionally do so in your application's
`Brocfile.js`.

```javascript
var app = new EmberApp({
  'spree-ember-storefront': {
    disableNormalize: true,
    disableFoundation: true
  }
});
```
